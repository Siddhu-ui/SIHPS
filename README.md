Success Story Tracking: Features on both web and mobile apps to showcase and track alumni achievements, success stories, and notable contributions to society, inspiring current students and fostering pride among alumni. Events and Reunions: Announcements, registrations, and management tools available on both platforms for organizing alumni events, reunions, workshops, and professional development sessions to maintain engagement and connection. Feedback and Surveys: Channels on both web and mobile apps for alumni to provide feedback on their experiences, suggest improvements, and participate in surveys to help shape future initiatives of the association. The platform will prioritize user experience, security, and scalability across both web and mobile applications to cater to the diverse needs of the Government Engineering College's alumni community. Expected Solution: Implementation of the Alumni Association platform for the Government Engineering College, comprising both web and mobile applications, is expected to achieve several positive outcomes: Enhanced Alumni Engagement: Seamless access to networking, career opportunities, and alumni events through web and mobile apps will strengthen connections among alumni, fostering a vibrant and active community.
